## Last Week's Accomplishments

> We decided to change our framework from Flask to React to make the transition to the backend smoother. I also finished implementing my progress page
for the website in html and committed it. Peter also created a login page and Sakarth was working on creating an interactive page where students could 
practice and test their code. 


## This Week's Plan

> We are going to begin the transition from Flask to React, so we are going to begin React tutorials and hopefully be able to use our already implemented
webpages with this new framework. We also just gained a new group member, so we are going to catch him up to speed on the frontend while he informs us of 
what is happening on the backend. This new group member works as the transition from front end to backend so that reading off the data from the json battles
goes more smoothely

## Anything Blocking?

> We just changed frameworks, so now it feels like we are taking a few steps back since we have to learn React when we just were getting familiar with 
Flask. We also just added a group member, so getting used to this new dynamic will also be a transition.
