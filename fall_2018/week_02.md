## Last Week's Accomplishments

>We started to wireframe some of the pages of our site and decided to use boostrap and flask to create the website.  

## This Week's Plan

>We are going to assign roles within our small group and continue to get familar with bootstrap and flask by following the tutorials Ethan suggested we do. 
We also are going to continue wireframing the rest of the webpages.
