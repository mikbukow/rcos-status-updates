## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I implemented the tracking progress webage in html, css and bootstrap


## This Week's Plan

> We plan to create json files with "data" that will eventually be replaced with the data of the student's progress and all the projects they can do


## Anything Blocking?

> got some errors when running a few flask test cases and cannot figure out why 
> still have to get familar with Flask and figure out how to read the json files into the code

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
