## Last Week's Accomplishments

> We got familar with bootstrap, html, and css and will begin to start implementing some of the web pages. We will try to use our wireframes as guides so that our pages have the same style.
We were all given a page to create and I was given the progress page


## This Week's Plan

> We plan to create json files with "data" that will eventually be replaced with the data of the student's progress and all the projects they can do and to finish implementing the pages were each assigned to create. I am also still trying to get comfortable will flask as I am getting a few errors with it. 


## Anything Blocking?

> got some errors when running a few flask test cases and cannot figure out why 
> still have to get familar with Flask and figure out how to read the json files into the code

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
