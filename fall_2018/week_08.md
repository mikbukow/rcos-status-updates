## Last Week's Accomplishments

> We started to do tutorials on React so that we are able to switch the code we have already written in HTML to JSX. I have gotten through the entire
tutorial, it was a tic tac toe game. I then began to practice small little problems on my own to get a better understanding. Sakarth and Jake have been working
more on the transition to backend and putting data into the json files.  


## This Week's Plan

> We are planning to finally convert the written html webpage template files to jsx so that we can get our website to run locally. We are also going 
to create more template webpages for the pages we have not created yet using our wireframes. 

> Examples: 

## Anything Blocking?

> We are still trying to get familiar with React.js it was deffinitely a challenge to switch frameworks in the middle of the semester, especially since
we have already written code that worked with the previous framework. So the only thing blocking is learning React and transitioning our old webpages to 
work with the new framework.
