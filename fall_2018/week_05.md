## Last Week's Accomplishments

> We began to finally start coding with html and bootstrap. I did a few small snipets of practice code and followed some tutorials to get the hang of it.
We used to wirframes as template designs to start implementing web pages. I created the progress page, the page that students can use to track their
progress on current projects they are working on and projects they have already completed. 

## This Week's Plan

> We realized that React might be a better framework than flask, so this weeks task is to begin getting familar with React and also continue to implement
web pages. We are going to see if flask is still a viable framework to use so our work isnt lost, but it's looking like we are going to switch to React after
touching base with the backend team.

## Anything Blocking?

> After talking with the backend team, we realized Flask might not be the best framework to use. React would be a better one to use. We now are going to
start learning react. If we do switch, this will be kind of like moving back since we finally started getting used to Flask.
