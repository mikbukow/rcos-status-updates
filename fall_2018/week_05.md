## Last Week's Accomplishments

> We started to use html and bootstrap to begin coding some of the website pages that we wireframed earlier. I finished a progess page with the help of
some online tutorials.


## This Week's Plan

> We plan to continue creating the web pages and also learn React

> Examples: 

## Anything Blocking?

> We realized flask wasnt the best frameowork for our website, so we decided to switch to React so we have to learn that now.

## Notes
