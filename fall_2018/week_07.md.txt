## Last Week's Accomplishments

> WE created a new repository called spaceport. We all were able to create our own branches and I commited my progress page for the website. Jake also
joined our team, so now we have a smoother transition from frontend to backend since he has been working alot with the backend. We installed yarn so we 
can run our website locally. 


## This Week's Plan

> This week's plan is to continue getting familiar with React and working on website templates. We also need to work on getting our templates more integrated
with the React code. Right now we are working on getting our first committed page to work with React.

## Anything Blocking?

> Right now the templates we have written for the wesbite is not working with the React code. So this is something we plan to fix this week.
