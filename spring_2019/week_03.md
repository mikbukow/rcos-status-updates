## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I basically finished the projects page and project page is complete. I need to add 
a card component and a carousel component to the projects page, but I am having trouble
with the installation of all the modules. I have commited my pages to the repository. 


## This Week's Plan

I need to implement the cards and carousel on the projects page and then i need to make
mock data in json files and begin to read the mock data off the files and into the website.
I am still confused on how to do this, so I will read up on documentation before next friday. 

## Anything Blocking?

I am still having issues creating a carsousel of cards, so I m going to try and different approach to this
that hopefully will work. Instead of trying to create the cards within the same file as 
the project view, I will create it in a component and then import it into the project page
 

## Notes

> This past week and the upcoming week are just very busy weeks for me.
