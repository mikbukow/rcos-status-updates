## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I finished my implementation of the downloads page and made a pull request on github. There were so more styling issues after this, but we were able to fix them pretty quickly. We pretty much reached
most of the goals we had set for the implentation of our website this semester. We are now going to work on our slides for the presentation. 


## This Week's Plan
This week's plan is to work on our slides for the presentation, and look over the website to see if we should make any last minutes fixes or changes. 

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing really blocking
