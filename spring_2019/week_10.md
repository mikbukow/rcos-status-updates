## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This week we finished our slides and did a run through of our presentation. We practiced making it below the time limit since we are a larger group. We winged it the first time we did a run through
but now we have more of a format of what we are going to say. 

## This Week's Plan
This weeks plan is to do our presentation and to set some goals for next semester.

## Anything Blocking?
