## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I added the card component. I created a card container class and a card class to do this. I also was able to create some mock data with
json files and read the data in. I started to read in data for the individual project page but for the most part the projects page is done besides
some styling issues. 


## This Week's Plan
This week's plan is to finish the project page and create some more json test files. Right now, my json files only have one test, but i would like
to try it with many since there are obviously going to be more than one project. If i complete this, i am going to next work on some of my styling issues
but the main goal for this week is to finish the project page and get better test json files. 

## Anything Blocking?

The carousel thing is still and issue but now that i have the card component working, i have a better plan at how to approach this.
