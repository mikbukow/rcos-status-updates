## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week we decided that our website would have 3 main features: Projects, curriculum and articles. There are 3 of us in our small subgroup 
so we were each assinged a feature. I was assinged the projects feature. We each made mock ups of our feature. I made my mockups using Figma. So I had 
2 mockups: A projects page listing all the possible projects and a project page describing one specific project. 


## This Week's Plan

This week's plan is to begin coding our mockups in react and bootstrap. I plan to finish the individual projects page and get a good start on the 
multiple projects page. I'm also going to refresh my react knowledge because I forget it a little bit. 

## Anything Blocking?

Only thing really blocking was that I wasn't sure if the projects page should be unique to an individual so they can track their progress, or just a 
general page. So I made 2 mockups one for each. We now decided that we'll just make a general page and implement the individual pages when we are 
farther along and have a website in tacked.
