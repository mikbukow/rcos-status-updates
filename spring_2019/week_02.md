## Last Week's Accomplishments

> We began to build our pages using mock data. I started bulding the project and projects page using react bootstrap and css. I am almost finished with the projects page and
have finished the general layout of the project page. I haven't began using mock data yet, because I want to first have the general page all set before loading in data from 
a json file.


## This Week's Plan

This week's plan is to finish my general layouts. I finished the singular project page layout (or at least a first draft of it) and am almost finished with the multiple
projects page. Once I finish my static views, I am going to begin loading in data off a json file. I hope to have all this done by next friday, but I have a test next week
so then the following Tuesday at the latest. 

## Anything Blocking?

For the multiple projects page, I plan to build a carousel of cards to allow users to be able to easly scroll through the different types of projects. I am having issues 
implementing this. I followed a tutorial from the react-boostrap website on how to accomplish this, and am having troubling importing the card module. I am going to look 
at further documentation for this and hopefully figure it out. I know how to build cards in html and bootstrap, so hopefully I can make it work.  

## Notes

> I have a lot going on next week: a test and 3 assignments due and also work, so I really need to manage my time well this next few days. I plan to get a lot done
over the weekend, takinh advantage of the extra day off.
