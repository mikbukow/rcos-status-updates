## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I finished the project page. So my project page and projects page are complete and i am able to read in data when i list it at the top in the same format
that a json file is in. When i try to read in the same info from a json file however, i get an error. I was doing some research on it bc i'm not sure what
the problem is, and it could be that i installed some of the babel wrong, or I'm getting my variables confused.  


## This Week's Plan
This weeks plan is find out what is causing my bug and fix it, because one i fix this i can pull request and we can start focusing on styling. 

## Anything Blocking?

reading in the json files in becoming tricky
