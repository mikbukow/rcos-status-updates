## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I made a pull request for the project and projects view. My branch was deleted because I had finished everything and the only thing that needs work still is the styling, but we are 
going to hold off on that until the whole website is completed so that the styling is consistent. I then began to create a mock up for the downloads page which is a static page 
showing the students how to download atom and choose projects to start working on. I started to then code the page.


## This Week's Plan
This weeks plan is to finish my implentation of the downloads page, and I am almost done with it. I need to get a view things about the downloads process clear first. We also
plan to work on and practice our presentation because we are going next week. 

## Anything Blocking?
