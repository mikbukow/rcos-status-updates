## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I have finished both my project view and my projects view. My json file was kinda messed up. I am now cleaning up my code because my code was a mess since i was trying to fix
the issue with reading in my json file. 


## This Week's Plan
This week's plan is to finish cleaning up my code and then create a pull request. After this i am going to work on styling. Ethan was saying the styling on all our pages was a little
different and he really liked the curriculum view so I am going to try and match that one. 

## Anything Blocking?
